# Training an arXiv Paper Classifier

Pre-training and finetuning language models to classifier whether papers are
relevant to a topic.

## Dataset

Download the arXiv dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv), the `mv` it to the `data` folder and `unzip archive.zip`.

I renamed the file format to `.jsonl` to be more precise.
